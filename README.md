# The Game Corner

### This is my final project in the course DT102G ASP.NET with C#

> The project is a .NET Entity Framework webbapplication where you can create an account to upload game art and download as well if you fancy to. 
> You can browse among gameart from all users and sort by different parameters. You can edit your own and delete. The whole app supports CRUD functionality.
